# Acer-V7-Aspire-482PG
Hackintosh project involving the Acer V7 Aspire 482pg Laptop

So far, I have managed to get the Acer laptop running on High Sierra (10.13.2)

**Working**
* Shutdown and Sleep
* Touch Screen
* Internal Graphics Card (Nvidia 750 will never work due to limitations with Optimus)
* Sound (ALC 282)
* Brightness
* CPU Power management
* Ethernet
* iMessage/iCloud/Facetime/Etc.


**Not Working**
* Wifi and Bluetooth (Intel Wifi cards do not work with Hackintosh. I use a USB Bluetooth/Wifi Dongle)
* Computer will boot to screen glitch (Will remain glitched until the laptop screen is closed, and then reopened)
